# Sunny Skies: User Guide

Welcome to **Sunny Skies**, your personal engine for simulating fantastical weather! This guide will show you how to create stunning, high-fidelity visuals of weather events that exist only in your imagination.

## How to Create Your First Simulation (In 5 Steps)

Creating a simulation is easy. Just follow these steps:

### Step 1: Dream Up an Anomaly

This is the fun part! In the **Fantastical Anomaly** box, describe the weird, wild, or wonderful weather you want to see. The more descriptive you are, the better the result.

*   **Need an idea?** Click the **âœ¨ (Suggest)** button, and the AI will invent a creative starting point for you.
*   **Want to brainstorm?** Click the **ðŸ’¬ (Assistant)** button to open a chat with an AI creative partner who can help you refine your ideas into the perfect prompt.

### Step 2: Pick a Location

In the **Location** box, type in any real-world place. As you type, suggestions will appear. Select one.

This is where the magic begins. When you choose a location, Sunny Skies does two things instantly:
1.  **Fetches Live Weather**: It pulls in the current, real-world weather conditions for that exact spot.
2.  **Generates a "Live View"**: Our **WeatherNext** engine generates a real-time satellite photograph of your location. You'll see this image appear, giving you a sneak peek of the environment.

### Step 3: (Optional) Add Advanced Data

For the true weather enthusiast! Click the toggle switch next to **Advanced Data Layers** to reveal a set of professional-grade data feeds. By flipping these switches, you can tell the AI to make its simulation even more realistic by including:

*   **Live satellite imagery** for cloud patterns.
*   **Detailed terrain maps** so the anomaly interacts with mountains and valleys correctly.
*   **Real-time oceanographic data** for coastal simulations.
*   And much more!

### Step 4: Choose Your Style

How do you want to see your simulation?

*   **Images**: A beautiful, cinematic, ground-level view of the event.
*   **Satellite**: A top-down, tactical view, like you're seeing it from space.

### Step 5: Simulate!

Hit the **Simulate Anomaly** button and watch it go! The engine will now process all your inputs to create a unique, high-fidelity image of your fantastical weather event, perfectly grounded in the location you chose.

## The Engine Behind the Magic

Sunny Skies is more than just a random image generator. It uses a powerful, multi-step process to make your simulations feel plausible and deeply connected to their environment.

### 1. Context is Everything: The "WeatherNext" Live View

When you pick a location, we don't just use the name. Our **WeatherNext** data engine generates a fresh satellite image of that location. This image becomes a crucial visual reference for the AI.

### 2. The AI Becomes an Artist and a Scientist

Instead of just mashing your text and location together, our simulation engine does something smarter:

*   **It Analyzes the View**: The AI first looks at the "Live View" satellite image. It studies the terrain, the layout of the city, the real cloud formations, and the geography.
*   **It Re-imagines the Prompt**: Based on its visual analysis, the AI writes a new, much more detailed prompt for itself. For example, if you ask for a "Glass Hailstorm" over Denver, the AI sees the Rocky Mountains in the satellite view and might rewrite the prompt to be: *"A dramatic storm releases glittering shards of glass hail that shatter against the rugged peaks of the Rocky Mountains just west of Denver's city skyline."*
*   **It Creates the Final Image**: The AI uses this new, enriched prompt to generate the final simulation. This is why the final image looks so uniquely tailored to its locationâ€”because it is!

This context-aware process ensures that every simulation is a one-of-a-kind piece of art, blending your imagination with real-world detail.

Enjoy exploring the skies!
